# 📚 Smart Study Planner

**Smart Study Planner** is high-performance web application designed to help students manage their time intelligently. Unlike traditional to-do lists, this app uses a custom algorithm to generate a dynamic study schedule based on subject difficulty, exam dates, and user availability.


## 🚀 The Problem
Many students struggle with time management, often leading to "cramming" before exams, burnout, and poor retention of information. Existing digital planners are often too manual, requiring users to decide exactly what to study and when.

## ✨ The Solution
This application automates the planning process. By inputting subjects and deadlines, the **Smart Study Planner** calculates a logical distribution of study sessions, prioritizing harder subjects and upcoming exams to ensure a balanced and effective preparation phase.
